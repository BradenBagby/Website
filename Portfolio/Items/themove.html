                                        <strong>Background:</strong><br> The Move LLC is a company started by me and 2 friends. The Move took around 1.5 years to complete the MVP, including planning, structure, and implementing many changes. I was the
                                        sole/lead developer for The Move during the entire development of the MVC. The Move is a social media for going out. It includes everything your used to on a social media platform. In app messaging, add and remove
                                        friends by username or QRCode, update profile image, etc. You can create a 'Move' in your area, see who is going where, and upload stories to Moves. For more information on what the app does, view the AppStore Listing
                                        section.

                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Planning:</strong><br> We spent months listing the app's requirements, designing the architecture for the database and the app itself, and designing the UI. I personally designed the database and app architecture
                                        while only helping with UI ideas. I created documents for every class in the app. Created documents for every entry in the NoSQL database. We did end up changing the direction we were going and scrapping around
                                        half of the inital planning, but the way we laid out the entire app allowed us to implement these changes without re-developing the entire thing.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Development:</strong><br> App is written in Flutter and uses Firestore NoSQL database for real time updates and Node.js for backend. App has in app messaging, DM your friends or create group chats that delete
                                        after 24 hours. Add friends by searching for username, contacts, or using your custom QRCode. You can create up to two moves a day that will be displayed to anyone within a 10 mile radius. Notifications to users
                                        for top moves, deals in their area, messaging, etc. Users can choose what to be notified on in the settings. Take pictures and upload them as stories to each move. These stories are only visible by your friends
                                        and delete after 24 hours. Figure out what The Move is in your area by seeing how many people and which of your friends are going to each move. Businesses can add their local business that will stay on the listing
                                        permanently. Businesses can purchase a permium subscription to list daily deals that will display a banner on their listing. A lot of functionality exists in this app as it is a complete social media.
